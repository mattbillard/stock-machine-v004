LEARNED / SELF-REMINDERS


ANGULAR
- Enable Express to distinguish between normal and XHR reqs by putting the following in app.config $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'] = 'XMLHttpRequest';

GULP
- Require()s at the top slow down the initialization of gulp considerably. Move them into the tasks that you need them.

NODE/EXPRESS
- Errors
    - Node/Express have gotten a lot better at handling errors without crashing the whole server. Just make sure your error handler logs it.
    - HTTP vs XHR:
        - HTTP: use res.render('error') to serve a error webpage
        - XHR: use res.send('ERROR: '+err) so XHR errors return just a message and not a whole webpage with tons of HTML

MONGODB / MONGOOSE
- Count: to get the count, you need to do queries
- Mongoose doesn't care what order you do .sort().limit().skip()

TYPESCRIPT
- IntelliJ uses an outdated version of TypeScript. Update TypeScript with "npm update typescript -g". Then in the settings, point the "Compiler Version" to /usr/local/lib/node_modules/typescript/lib
